# VertexInfo-Unity

A pretty simple component that gives additional information on your mesh vertices.

Just add the component to the object with mesh that you want to inspect and click away on vertices to see more information.

The inspector is pretty simple so you can easily change the `ShowVertex(int index)` method to modify the displayed data.
